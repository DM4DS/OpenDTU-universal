# OpenDTU-universal
OpenDTU with both Chipsets for usage with "all" Inverters

The Board is designed to work with the E49-900M20S and the NRF24L01.
It is powered via 5V terminals, powering the ESP32, which provides the 3.3V for the modules and the I2C OLED display (1.3").

I will update the repo after i received my PCBs and tested them.

Then I will also design a 3D printed housing and upload it to the repo, so you maybe wanna come back to update your downloaded files.

While I´m still waiting to receive my PCBs, I can not guarantee that everything works! Check all connections, the wiring, etc. Especially on the OLED, while I switch GND and Vcc for easier routing.

Will update this text, too, after all is tested etc.

happy soldering
